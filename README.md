## Configuration

### Config File

You have several options for passing configuration values. This utility uses [rc](https://github.com/dominictarr/rc) to parse a configuration file. It also accepts command line arguments and environment variables.

Create a `.testbox-runnerrc` file in the root of your project (where you will run textbox-runner). This file can be either in ini or JSON format and should contain the following options:

* `runner` (required) - This is the URL to your test runner.  This should point to the HTMLRunner.cfm file that ships with testbox (/testbox/system/runners/HTMLRunner.cfm).  It can be your own custom runner as long as it accepts the same URL parameters as HTMLRunner.cfm.
* `directory` (required if `bundles` is not provided) - The directory of your tests.
* `recurse` (optional, default is `false`) - Indicates if you want to recurse the directory provided in the `directory` option.  Must be a boolean.
* `bundles` (required if `directory` is not provided)
* `labels` - The string or list of labels the runner will use to execute suites and specs with.

#### Example

##### JSON

```JSON
{
	"runner": "http://localhost/testbox/system/runners/HTMLRunner.cfm",
	"directory": "/tests",
	"recurse": true
}
```

##### ini

```ini
runner = http://localhost/testbox/system/runners/HTMLRunner.cfm
directory = /tests
recurse = true
```

The utility will look in several places for the `.testbox-runnerrc` file.  See the [rc](https://github.com/dominictarr/rc) documentation for more information on locations searched.  

`testbox-runner`

You can also specify a specific configuration file:

`testbox-runner --config /path/to/config/file.json`

### Command Line Arguments

Simply run the utility and pass the above configuration options prefixed with `--`.

#### Example

`testbox-runner --runner http://localhost/testbox/system/runners/HTMLRunner.cfm --directory /tests --recurse true`
